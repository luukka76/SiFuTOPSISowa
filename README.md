Abstract:
We present similarity based fuzzy Technique for Order of Preferences by Similarity to Ideal Solution (fTOPSIS) using ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators. 
With OWA operators we extend the use of similarity based fTOPSIS in two ways. First in several types of real world engineering decision making problems the amount of criteria 
required to be satisfied to a high extent is more important than satisfying particular criteria; also in the aggregation of expert evaluations the amount of experts providing
good/bad evaluations might be critical. This kind of generalization is now made possible by using OWA in the proposed method. Second by using linguistic quantifiers to define
weights for OWA and allowing different quantification for the similarity to Fuzzy Positive Ideal Solution (FPIS) and Fuzzy Negative Ideal Solution (FNIS) we allow 
decision-maker’s risk preference to be reflected. This allows us to model risk-averse or risk-seeking decision making in fTOPSIS for the first time. Aggregation of multiple 
expert evaluations using fTOPSIS that considers specific linguistically expressed risk-attitude of the user of the final evaluation is now also enabled in fTOPSIS. The advantage
of the proposed method lies in the ability to adjust the method according to decision makers’ risk preferences. Multiple expert evaluations can also now be aggregated according 
to the end-user’s risk preference. The proposal enables separate treatment of FPIS and FNIS using OWA operators to reflect decision maker’s optimism/pessimism. Presented 
findings show that by doing this we are able to reflect risk attitudes and receive different ranking corresponding with risk preferences.
